## Major ongoing projects
* I help write documentation and plan ideas for [@SideStore](https://github.com/SideStore) ([website](https://sidestore.io)), an alternative iOS/iPadOS app store for seamless sideloading. No jailbreak needed, and no computer after the initial install, only a Wi-Fi connection.
* I help develop [Juxtaposition](https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/juxtaposition), [Pretendo Network](https://pretendo.network)'s [Miiverse](https://miiwiki.org/wiki/Miiverse) replacement and successor. ([Pretendo Network](https://pretendo.network) is a free and open source replacement for Nintendo's servers for both the 3DS and Wii U.)
* I created ["Epoch Semantic Versioning"](https://github.com/EpochSemVer/EpochSemVer/blob/main/VERSIONING.md), which contains a set of rules and requirements that dictate how version numbers are assigned and incremented. It differs from Semantic Versioning by introducing an epoch version, which either creates *a leading 4th number* or *a 3rd number with a zero-padded divider between the epoch and breaking versions* that is both machine-readable and understandable by humans.
